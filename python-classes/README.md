Python programming embraces Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), which organizes code into classesâ€”blueprints for creating objects (instances) that encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods). Each object can have public, protected, or private attributes, defining its accessibility. The self keyword refers to the instance itself, while methods are functions defined within a class. The special __init__ method initializes new instances. Key OOP concepts include data abstraction (hiding complexity), data encapsulation (bundling data and methods), and information hiding (restricting access to certain details). Properties allow controlled access to attributes, differentiating them from regular attributes. The Pythonic way to implement getters and setters uses the @property decorator. You can dynamically add attributes to instances and manage class attributes. Each object or class has a __dict__ that stores its attributes, and Python resolves attribute access through a defined order. The getattr function retrieves attribute values dynamically, enhancing flexibility in coding.

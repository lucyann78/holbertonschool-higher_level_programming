Python exceptions are events that disrupt the normal flow of a program's execution. They occur when an error is encountered, such as attempting to divide by zero, accessing a nonexistent file, or using an invalid index in a list. Python provides a robust mechanism for handling these exceptions through the use of try, except, and finally blocks. By wrapping code that may raise exceptions in a try block, developers can catch and handle specific exceptions gracefully, allowing the program to continue running or to terminate in a controlled manner. This enhances the reliability and user experience of Python applications.

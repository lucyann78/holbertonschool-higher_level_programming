This README provides an overview of key concepts related to databases and MySQL. A database is an organized collection of data, while a relational database stores data in tables linked by relationships. SQL, or Structured Query Language, is the standard language for managing relational databases, with MySQL being a popular open-source RDBMS. To create a database in MySQL, use CREATE DATABASE database_name;. DDL (Data Definition Language) includes commands like CREATE and ALTER, while DML (Data Manipulation Language) involves SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE commands. To create a table, use CREATE TABLE table_name (column1 datatype, ...);, and to select data, execute SELECT * FROM table_name;. Data can be inserted, updated, or deleted using their respective commands. Subqueries allow nested queries for complex operations, and MySQL functions enable various data manipulations, enhancing the capabilities of SQL queries.

This project focuses on learning the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. Here, you will explore abstract classes to define common interfaces and ensure method implementation in derived classes. It also covers interfaces and duck typing, ensuring that objects adhere to specific contracts. You will learn to subclass standard base classes like lists and dictionaries to create custom data structures, as well as use method overriding to modify the behavior of base classes. Additionally, the project delves into multiple inheritance to form complex relationships between classes and the use of mixins to compose behaviors across unrelated classes. This project serves as an excellent resource for developing OOP skills in Python.

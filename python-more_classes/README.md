This project employs Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a paradigm that organizes code into classes and objects. A class serves as a blueprint for creating objects (instances), which encapsulate attributes and methods. Key concepts include attributes, which store data and can be public, protected, or private, and the special __init__ method, used for initializing attributes upon instance creation. Properties provide controlled access to attributes, while the special methods __str__ and __repr__ offer user-friendly and developer-oriented representations of objects, respectively. Understanding these principles enables effective code organization and abstraction in Python.

In Python, a superclass (or base/parent class) provides attributes and methods that can be inherited by subclasses, enabling code reuse and hierarchical relationships. To list all attributes and methods of a class or instance, you can use the dir() function. Instances can gain new attributes at any time by direct assignment. Classes inherit from others by specifying the superclass in parentheses during definition, and multiple inheritance is possible by listing multiple base classes. Every class implicitly inherits from the object class. Subclasses can override inherited methods or attributes to customize behavior. They inherit public and protected members from their superclasses, while private members are not accessible. The purpose of inheritance is to promote code organization and reusability. Built-in functions like isinstance, issubclass, type, and super are essential for type checking, class hierarchy verification, accessing superclass methods, and managing object-oriented design effectively.

An interactive test involves direct user interaction with an application to validate its functionality, essential for ensuring quality and detecting bugs early in development. Writing effective tests is crucial as they prevent regressions and serve as documentation for the code. To create tests, use docstrings to describe functions, including their purpose, parameters, and return values, while maintaining a consistent format across modules. Basic option flags like -v for verbosity and --maxfail to limit failures enhance test execution. Additionally, finding edge cases involves testing boundary values, invalid inputs, and empty states to ensure robustness in diverse scenarios.
